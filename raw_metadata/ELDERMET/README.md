Description of Dietary Groups (DGs) 

DG1: The predominant features of this diet type include consumption of complex carbohydrates 
(including wholegrain breakfast cereals, breads, boiled potato), daily consumption of a wide range of 
fruit and vegetables and moderate (5 times/week) consumption of protein-rich white meat, fish and 
eggs. Red-meat was consumed in moderation by this group while oily fish were consumed once per 
week with low intakes of dairy produce (approx. 3 times/week) and high-sugar/low-nutrient dense 
foods.

DG2: Both complex (wholegrain breakfast cereals and breads, boiled potatoes) and simple 
carbohydrates (white bread) were consumed frequently in this diet type. A lower variety of fruit and 
vegetables were consumed, less frequently (two-three times/daily) compared to DG1. Red-meat, fish 
or eggs were consumed daily with reduced consumption of oily fish. Intakes of dairy produce were 
lower among this group (approx. once weekly) with higher intakes of high-sugar/low-nutrient dense 
foods compared to diet type 1. 

DG3: Overall, this diet group contained the least variety of all the DGâ€™s. Porridge and mashed potato 
were the main daily staples while simple carbohydrate (white bread) was consumed frequently with 
little inclusion of wholemeal varieties. Consumption and variety of fruit and vegetables were lowest 
overall among this group (approx. 1-2 portions daily). Processed and unprocessed meat and eggs were 
consumed once or twice a day with little fish consumed. Intakes of dairy produce were low (once a 
week) with the lowest consumption of high-sugar/low-nutrient dense foods. 

DG4: Similar to diet type 3, mashed potato and porridge were the only staples in this diet type and 
were consumed daily. Fruit and vegetable consumption was comparable with that of diet group 1 but with
much less variety. Processed and unprocessed meat were consumed daily and fried fish were 
consumed once a week. There was no consumption of fresh fish by these subjects. Dairy products and 
high-sugar/low-nutrient dense foods were consumed frequently by this cohort (once-twice and 3-4 
times daily, respectively), predominantly full-fat dairy produce and puddings, and sweetened hot 
beverages which were consumed 1-3 times daily.
